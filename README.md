# Digital Literacy Calculator Rewrite Part Two Electric Boogaloo
My original [Python project](https://github.com/JustASpeedrunner/DigitalLiteracyCalculator) [rewritten in Lua](https://github.com/JustASpeedrunner/DigitalLiteracyCalculatorRewrite) rewritten in Rust.

### I am very new to Rust, feel free to create PRs and fix unoptimal code.


## How To Run
### Method 1 (Recommended)
-Install [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)

-Download the main.rs file from this repo

-Locate the directory which you downloaded the main.rs file to and run `rustc main.rs`

-Then run the resulting executable

### Method 2
-Download a binary from the [releases](https://github.com/JustASpeedrunner/DigitalLiteracyCalculatorRewritePartTwo/releases) tab

**NOTE:** I cannot guarentee the functionality of binaries for Windows, as I do not have a machine to test it on. If the binary does not work for you, please use Method 1.

In case you for some reason wanted to git clone and use this, it's licensed under the GPL3 license.
